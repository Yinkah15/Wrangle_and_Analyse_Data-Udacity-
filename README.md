# Wrangle_and_Analyse_Data-Udacity-
In this project , I wrangled and analysed data which was merged into one file (collated from three sources)

## Description
The project is carried out on tweets from a popular twitter page named 'WeRateDogs'. The tweets usually contain ratings of dogs over a scale of 10. 
More often than not, the scores given are above 10 and this would not be adjusted for the project.
Data for the project would be gathered from three sources, assesses , cleaned, analysed and visualised. Some insights would also be highlighted

The act_report.pdf and wrangle_report.pdf documents give a summary of the work done.

The detailed code and step-by-step process is in the wrangle_act.ipynb file.

## Dependencies
Tools imported include pandas, os, requests, tweepy, numpy, matplotlib
