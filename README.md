# Wrangle_and_Analyse_Data-Udacity-
In this project , I wrangled and analysed data which was merged into one file but collated from three sources

## Description
The project is carried out on tweets from a popular twitter page named 'WeRateDogs'. The tweets usually contain ratings of dogs over a scale of 10. 
More often than not, the scores given are above 10 and this would not be adjusted for the project.
Data for the project would be gathered from three sources, assesses , cleaned, analysed and visualised. Some insights would also be highlighted

## Dependencies
Tools imported include pandas, os, requests, tweepy, numpy, matplotlib
